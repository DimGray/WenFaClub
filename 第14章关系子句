形容词子句又称关系子句
  关系子句中连接词都是句子中内含子眼的改写，而名词子句和副词子句的连接词都是外加的。
  I know that I am right.
  I know this because I have proof.
  I don't trust people who talked too much.
  
关系子句中与主要子句的交集点：可能是代名词，也可能是副词，分别称关系代名词，关系副词。
  he she they        who
  it they            which
  his her their its  whose
  him her them       whom
  
  then               when
  there              where
  so                 how
  for a reason       why
  
关系代名词中who和which有时可用that取代，指示的作用,补充说明时则不取代。
  Man is an animal that is capable of reason.
  I like TIME Classic Words, which many people like, too.
  I like books, whatever the subjects, that have illustration.
  
先行词的省略
  两个条件：1.先行词得是空的，没有内容的字眼，像thing，people
          2.关系子句与先行词之间没有逗号
  I have the thing you need.
  I have what you need.
  I'll shoot whoever moves.
  
关系子句的位置
  You can find two apples which I bought in the basket.
  You can find two apples in the basket which I bought.
  In the basket you can find two apples which I bought.  true
  
  A plague which lasted 20 years broke out.
  A plague broke out which lasted 20 years.   true
  
关系副词
  有逗号不省略。
  
有逗号的关系子句
  补充说明的功能，不省略，不用that。
  
wh-ever与副词子句
  如果解释为no matter wh-,近似让步、条件的语气，其后的子句要当副词子句解释，直接附在主要子句上做修饰语。
  如果解释为anyone/anything that，就是关系子句省略掉先行词，后面的字句因而要当名词子句的解释，在主要子句中扮演主词，受词..等的名词角色。
  Whichever way you go, I'll follow.
  Whichever way you go is fine with me.
