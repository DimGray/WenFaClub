合句
  如果是两个能够各自独立的单句，中间以and, but, or等连接词连起来，两句之间维持平行，对称的关系，
没有主从之分，就称为合句（compound sentence）,又称对等子句。

复句
  如果将一个句子改造成名词，形容词或副词类，放到另一句中使用，就称为从属子句，另一句就称为主要子句，
合并而成的句子有主从之分，就称为复句(complex sentence).复句的从属子句有三种，分别为名词子句，形
容词子句，副词子句。

典型的名词子句具有以下几点特色
  1. 本身原来是一个完整的单句
  2. 前面加上连接词that, 这个连接词没有意义，只有文法功能，表示后面跟着一个名词子句
  3. 名词子句需放在主要子句的名词位置（主词，受词，补语，同位语等位置），当做名次使用。
  
主词位置
  Something is strange.
  He didn't show up on time.
  That he didn't show up on time is strange.
  It is strange that he didn't show up on time.
  
受词位置
  The defendant said something.
  He didn't do it.
  The defendant said that he didn't do it.
  
  I find somethig strange.
  He didn't show up on time.
  I find it strange that he didn't show up on time.
  
补语位置
  The car is ruined. The most important thing is that we are all right.
  
同位格位置
  The story that he once killed a man might just be true.
  
  I am afraid of that thing.
  I can't help you.
  I'm afraid that I can't help you.
  
  You'd better take care of that thing.
  Nothing goes wrong.
  You'd better take care that nothing goes wrong.
  
名词放大
  I suppose that this is your last offer?
  This is your last offer, I suppose?
  
  Dr.Chang, Director of the Yangmingshan Geological Observatory, said that the earthquake was a 6.9.
  The earthquake was a 6.9, Dr.Chang, Director of the Yangmingshan Geological Observatory, said.
  The earthquake was a 6.9, said Dr.Chang, Director of the Yangmingshan Geological Observatory.
  
疑问句个改装的名词子句
  典型的名词子句是外加连接词that表示那件事情（that thing）,另外以疑问词(who, what, when等)引导的疑问句，也可以改装成名词子句，
代表一个问题（question）。
  I know the question.
  Who are you?
  I know who you are.
  
  The question is anybody's guess.
  When will the bomb go off?
  When the bomb will go off is anybody's guess.
  
Whether and if
  疑问词改装的名词子句比较特别的是由whether引导的名词子句。whether不能独立地做疑问词引导一个带问号的疑问句，
可是它可以引导代表一个问题的名词子句。
  I can't tell which.
  Either he's telling the truth or he's not
  I can't tell whether he's telling the truth or not.
  whether解释为是否大多数情况下可以和if互换，句首以及介系词后面就只能用whether，if放句首会让读者误以为是如果，介系词后面
只能是名词片语，不适合使用连接词，whether是which和either2，其中的which是代名词类，可以做介系词的受词。

总结
  名词子句有两种形态：
    1. 完整的单句外加无意义的连接词that, 代表那件事
    2. 疑问词引导的疑问句改装，不加连接词，代表那个问题
