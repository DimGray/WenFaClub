倒装句是一种把动词或者助动词移到主词前面的句型

比较级的倒装

关系子句的倒装
  The President is a man on whom a heavy responsibility, whether he likes it or not, falls.
  The President is a man on whom falls a heavy responsibility, whether he likes it or not.
  
假设语气的倒装
  在假设语句的副词子句里（往往由if引导），如果有be动词或助动词，就可以考虑倒装，做法是把连接词省略掉，
把be动词或助动词移到主词前面来取代连接词的功能，但若副词子句没有be动词或助动词，则不能倒装。
  If I had been there, I could have done something to help.
  Had I been there, I could have done something to help.
  
引用句的倒装
  在直接引句与间接引句中都可以选择使用倒装句来突出句中的重点。
  The police said:"None was killed in this accident."
  "None was killed in this accident", said the police.(the police said.)
  
  The WHO warns that cholera is coming back.
  Cholera, warns the WHO, is coming back.
  
类似there is/are的倒装
  把地方副词挪到句首，句型和there is/are的句型很接近，修辞功能在于强调语气，以及衔接上下文。
  There goes the train.
  Here is your ticket for the opera.
  In Loch Ness dwells a mysterious monster.
  
  To the west of Taiwan lies Southern China.
  To the east spreads the expanse of the Pacific.
  
否定副词开头的倒装
  如果把表示否定意味的副词（not, never, hardly..）挪到句首来强调语气，就得使用倒装句。
  We don't have such luck every day.
  Not every day do we have such luck.
  
  I will not stop waiting for you until you are married.
  Not until you are married will I stop waiting for you.
